        finishing my final semester at El Camino, and will be transfering to Cal State Dominguez Hills in the fall of 2024! I have 
        experience coding in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Java, and C++. In the future I hope to be able to contribute something

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>If you were to tell me that I woud end up pursueing college a couple of year ago, I probably wouldn't have believed you. My family 
        is low-income and I wanted to pursue my own path of becoming a youtuber. It wasn't until the final month or so leading up to my
        high school graudation that I truly felt like I had my life had no direction. Between taking on adult responsibilities such as learning
        how to drive, resgistering to vote, working a job, as well as cooking and cleaning for yourself.
