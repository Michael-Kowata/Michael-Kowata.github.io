    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Welcome to my personal website! I am a undergraduate majoring in computer science. I am transferred from El Camino Community College, and am currently attending Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
        I have experience coding in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Java, and C++. My goal is to be able to contribute something meaningful to society and give back to the community through the creation of games/programs.

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p> I didn't know what I wanted to do until I reached my senior year of high school, which was when I first discovered Computer Science and programming. 
        Even now I'm still just trying to figure things out. 
        However if there is any single takeaway that I could give to younger me it would be to remain proactive, but always have a good reason for pursueing something. 
        Here are some of my 
        Highlights:
        <ul>
            <li>Transferred from El Camino maintaining a cumulative GPA of 3.68 and obtaining making the Dean's List 2 times.</li>
            <li>Been awarded the El Camino Academic Achievement Award. </li>
            <li>Contributed to 4 different open source projects.</li>
            <li>Published 2 technical blog posts.</li>
            <li>Developed a simple Cube Game in Unity.</li>
            <li>Was selected to represent my college in the first ever annual Stem Scholar Conference in Washington DC.</li>
        </ul>
        I hope to continue to growing and learning as I continue my educational journey.
