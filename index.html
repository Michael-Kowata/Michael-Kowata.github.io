    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Welcome to my personal website! I am a undergraduate majoring in computer science. I am currently a community college student
        finishing my final semester at El Camino, and will be transfering to Cal State Dominguez Hills in the fall of 2024! I have 
        experience coding in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Java, and C++. In the future I hope to be able to contribute something 
        meaningful to society and give back to the community. It's something that I thing is underappreciated a lot of the time, especially
        after having spent some time being in the program that brings people together.</p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>If you were to tell me that I woud end up pursueing college a couple of year ago, I probably wouldn't have believed you. My family 
        is low-income and I wanted to pursue my own path of becoming a youtuber. It wasn't until the final month or so leading up to my
        high school graudation that I truly felt like I had my life had no direction. I decided to talk to my counsoler and it was from then
        on out that lead to me joining a learning community cohort at my local community college. If there is any single takeaway that I could
        give to younger me it would be to remain proactive, but always have a good reason for pursueing something. Since then, I've been able to
        contribute to an open source project, travel to Washington D.C. for a stem conference, as well as be part of a business academy program. 
        Along the way I met many interesting people, and I hope to continue to growing and learning as I continue my educational journey.
